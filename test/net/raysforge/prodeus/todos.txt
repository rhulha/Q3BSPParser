Think about EnvProbe placements...


Node{
EnvProbe
probeSize=14.5,8,16
center=0,0,0
intensity=1
importance=1
pos=0,2.75,0
rotation=0,0,0
id=3
layer=-1
parent=-1
}


Look at Map2Emap.cleanUpBrushes()
// remove faces with more than 6 points.
// I think Prodeus crashes with too many faces.
// TODO: Look at this again sometime
