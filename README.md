# Q3BSPParser
A Quake3Arena BSP and MAP file parser written in Java

Update: Now contains a Quake2 Map to Prodeus Map Converter!

Here are the steps needed to convert Quake2 Base1 to Prodeus:

1. Buy, install and run Prodeus at least once.
2. Download and extract Base1.map from https://icculus.org/gtkradiant/downloads/1.5/gamepacks/q2-example-maps-2004-12-06.tar.gz
3. Download and extract quake2-neural-upscale-textures-2.0.1.zip from https://github.com/Calinou/quake2-neural-upscale
4. Download MapConverter from https://github.com/rhulha/Q3BSPParser/releases
5. If you want to decompile BSPs to Maps, I had great success using this: https://github.com/wfowler1/bsp-decompiler
